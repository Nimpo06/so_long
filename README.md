## This is the first grapgical project. It introduce the graphical library of 42 : the `minilibx`.

A simple 2D video game, with collectibles, ennemies and an exit door.
*Help this **sad child's spirit** <ins>collect</ins> **his birthday balloons** from this abandoned pizzeria, then go see the puppet so he <ins>can rest in peace</ins>.
Be careful not to cross paths with the **purple guy** at the risk of <ins>ending up in oblivion forever</ins>.*

### How to test the program ðŸ‘¾

**First, download the minilibx**
```
make minilibix
```

**Then you can run this to compile :**
```
make && ./cub3D maps/map.ber
```

---

You can remove binary and compiled files :
```
make fclean
```
If you want, you can clean the directory by removing the minilibx :
```
make fclean_mlx
```
